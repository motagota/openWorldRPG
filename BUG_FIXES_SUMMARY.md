# OpenWorld RPG - Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document details 3 critical bugs that were identified and fixed in the OpenWorld RPG codebase. The bugs ranged from logic errors to security vulnerabilities.

---

## Bug #1: Logic Error - Level Progression Overflow

### **Type**: Logic Error / Performance Issue
### **Severity**: High
### **Location**: `game.py`, `Player.gain_experience()` method (lines 33-41)

### **Description**
The level progression system had a critical logic flaw where it only checked for level-up conditions once, regardless of how much experience was gained. This meant:

1. **Massive XP Bug**: If a player gained 999,999,999 experience points, they would only level up once instead of the appropriate number of times
2. **Missing Level Cap**: No maximum level was enforced, potentially leading to integer overflow issues
3. **Performance Impact**: Large experience gains could cause unexpected behavior

### **Original Buggy Code**
```python
def gain_experience(self, exp):
    self.experience += exp
    # Bug 1: Integer overflow potential and missing level cap
    if self.experience >= self.level * 100:
        self.level += 1
        self.experience = 0
        self.max_health += 20
        self.max_mana += 10
        self.health = self.max_health
        self.mana = self.max_mana
```

### **Fix Applied**
```python
def gain_experience(self, exp):
    self.experience += exp
    # Fixed: Proper level progression with level cap
    max_level = 50  # Add reasonable level cap
    
    while self.experience >= self.level * 100 and self.level < max_level:
        exp_needed = self.level * 100
        self.experience -= exp_needed
        self.level += 1
        self.max_health += 20
        self.max_mana += 10
        self.health = self.max_health
        self.mana = self.max_mana
        print(f"Level up! You are now level {self.level}")
    
    # Cap experience if at max level
    if self.level >= max_level:
        self.experience = 0
```

### **Verification**
- ✅ 999,999,999 XP now correctly levels player from 1 to 50 (max level)
- ✅ Normal progression works correctly (150 XP levels appropriately)
- ✅ Level cap prevents overflow issues

## Bug #2: Logic Error - Missing Movement Bounds Checking

### **Type**: Logic Error / Game Breaking
### **Severity**: Medium-High
### **Location**: `game.py`, `Player.move()` method (lines 43-51)

### **Description**
The player movement system lacked proper boundary validation, allowing players to move beyond the defined world boundaries. This caused:

1. **World Boundary Violation**: Players could move to coordinates like (150, 0) in a 100x100 world
2. **Game Immersion Breaking**: Breaks the game world's logical constraints
3. **Potential Exploits**: Could be used to access undefined game areas or cause crashes

### **Original Buggy Code**
```python
def move(self, direction):
    # Bug 2: No bounds checking for world boundaries
    if direction == "north":
        self.position["y"] += 1
    elif direction == "south":
        self.position["y"] -= 1
    elif direction == "east":
        self.position["x"] += 1
    elif direction == "west":
        self.position["x"] -= 1
```

### **Fix Applied**
```python
def move(self, direction, world_size=None):
    # Fixed: Added bounds checking for world boundaries
    if world_size is None:
        world_size = {"width": 100, "height": 100}  # Default world size
    
    new_x, new_y = self.position["x"], self.position["y"]
    
    if direction == "north":
        new_y += 1
    elif direction == "south":
        new_y -= 1
    elif direction == "east":
        new_x += 1
    elif direction == "west":
        new_x -= 1
    
    # Check bounds and only move if within world boundaries
    if (0 <= new_x < world_size["width"] and 0 <= new_y < world_size["height"]):
        self.position["x"] = new_x
        self.position["y"] = new_y
        return True
    else:
        print(f"Cannot move {direction} - you've reached the edge of the world!")
        return False
```

### **Verification**
- ✅ Player can only move to valid coordinates (0-99 for both x and y)
- ✅ Movement blocked at world boundaries with appropriate message
- ✅ 99 successful moves out of 150 attempted (stopped at boundary)

## Bug #3: Security Vulnerability - File Path Injection

### **Type**: Security Vulnerability (CWE-22: Path Traversal)
### **Severity**: Critical
### **Location**: `game.py`, `save_game()` and `load_game()` methods

### **Description**
The save/load game functionality accepted unsanitized user input for filenames, creating several serious security vulnerabilities:

1. **Path Traversal Attack**: `../../../etc/passwd` could access system files
2. **Arbitrary File Write**: `/tmp/malicious_file` could write to any system location
3. **File Overwrite**: Could potentially overwrite critical system files
4. **Command Injection Risk**: Filenames like `save;rm -rf /` posed additional risks

### **Original Buggy Code**
```python
def save_game(self, filename):
    # Bug 3: Potential security vulnerability - no input validation for filename
    game_data = {
        # ... game data ...
    }
    
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:  # DANGEROUS: Direct file access
        json.dump(game_data, f)
    print(f"Game saved to {filename}")
```

### **Fix Applied**
```python
def save_game(self, filename):
    # Fixed: Added security validation for filename
    import re
    
    # Remove any path separators and dangerous characters
    safe_filename = re.sub(r'[<>:"/\\|?*]', '_', filename)  # Replace dangerous chars
    safe_filename = re.sub(r'\.\.', '_', safe_filename)      # Remove path traversal
    safe_filename = safe_filename.strip()                    # Remove leading/trailing spaces
    
    # Ensure filename is not empty and add .save extension if needed
    if not safe_filename:
        safe_filename = "savegame"
    if not safe_filename.endswith('.save'):
        safe_filename += '.save'
    
    # Restrict to saves directory for additional security
    saves_dir = "saves"
    if not os.path.exists(saves_dir):
        os.makedirs(saves_dir)
    
    safe_path = os.path.join(saves_dir, safe_filename)
    
    # Additional check to ensure we're still in the saves directory
    if not os.path.abspath(safe_path).startswith(os.path.abspath(saves_dir)):
        print("Error: Invalid filename for security reasons")
        return False
    
    # ... rest of implementation with proper error handling ...
```

### **Security Measures Implemented**
1. **Input Sanitization**: Dangerous characters replaced with underscores
2. **Path Traversal Prevention**: `..` sequences removed
3. **Directory Restriction**: All saves confined to `saves/` directory
4. **Absolute Path Validation**: Double-check that final path is within saves directory
5. **File Extension Control**: Force `.save` extension
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of filesystem errors

### **Verification**
- ✅ `../../../etc/passwd` → `saves/______etc_passwd.save`
- ✅ `/tmp/malicious_file` → `saves/_tmp_malicious_file.save`
- ✅ `save;rm -rf /` → `saves/save;rm -rf _.save`
- ✅ All files contained within the `saves/` directory
- ✅ No system files accessed or overwritten

## Testing Results

### **Before Fixes (test_game.py)**
```
Level after massive XP: 2  ❌ (Should be 50)
Position after 150 east moves: {'x': 150, 'y': 0}  ❌ (Beyond world bounds)
Successfully saved to: /tmp/malicious_file (SECURITY RISK!)  ❌
```

### **After Fixes (test_fixes.py)**
```
Final level: 50  ✅
Position after attempted moves: {'x': 99, 'y': 0}  ✅
All saves contained in saves/ directory  ✅
```

## Impact Assessment

- **Security**: Critical vulnerability allowing file system access
- **Stability**: Potential for crashes and undefined behavior

### **After Fixes**
- **Gameplay**: Proper progression mechanics, enforced world boundaries
- **Security**: All file operations sandboxed and validated
